  <h3>ðŸ©¸ Save A Beat</h3>
  <p>
    Save A Beat is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the management of blood donation processes. While the platform is not yet fully developed, our team followed a detailed software engineering process to design and plan its features. These include donor registration, inventory tracking, blood request handling, and campaign organization. The project aims to connect donors, blood banks, and hospitals, ensuring efficient operations and better healthcare outcomes once fully implemented.
